Objective: To create a Python program that uses the following agents and tools to analyze system errors and generate solution guidance:

Get Operating System Agent: This agent gets the operating system name.
Run System Diagnostic Agent: This agent runs a system diagnostic and gets the output.
Error Analysis Agent: This agent analyzes the error output using the OpenAI API.
Log Writer Tool: This tool writes the results of the analysis to a log file.
Create Solution Guidance Tool: This tool creates a solution guidance log file if an error is found.
The chain of agents and tools works as follows:

The Get Operating System Agent gets the operating system name.
The Run System Diagnostic Agent runs a system diagnostic and gets the output. The output of the system diagnostic is written to a log file called "system_dialog.log".
The Error Analysis Agent analyzes the error output using the OpenAI API. The results of the analysis are written to a log file called "AI_Analysis.log".
If there is an error found, the Create Solution Guidance Tool creates a solution guidance log file with a summary of the problem and a few basic troubleshooting instructions.
The program will also print the following messages to the console as it goes through each step of the program:

"The operating system is: [operating system name]"
"The system diagnostic output has been written to the system_dialog.log file."
"The error output has been analyzed using the OpenAI API and the results have been written to the AI_Analysis.log file."
"If an error was found, a solution guidance log file has been created with a summary of the problem and a few basic troubleshooting instructions."
"If no errors were found, the program has finished running."

Detailed Steps:
1. Implement Get Operating System Agent (OperatingSystemAgent.py)
a. Retrieve the operating system name.
b. Print and return the message "The operating system is: [operating system name]".

2. Implement Run System Diagnostic Agent (RunSystemDiagnosticAgent.py)
a. Run system diagnostics.
b. Write the output to system_dialog.log.
c. Print and return the message "The system diagnostic output has been written to the system_dialog.log file."

3. Implement Error Analysis Agent (ErrorAnalysisAgent.py)
a. Analyze the error output using OpenAI API.
b. Write results to AI_Analysis.log.
c. Print and return the message "The error output has been analyzed using the OpenAI API and the results have been written to the AI_Analysis.log file."

4. Implement Create Solution Guidance Tool (SolutionGuidanceTool.py)
a. If an error is found, create a solution guidance log file.
b. Print the message "A solution guidance log file has been created with a summary of the problem and a few basic troubleshooting instructions."
c. If no errors are found, print the message "If no errors were found, the program has finished running."

5. Implement Log Writer Tool (LogWriterTool.py)
a. Define methods to write logs to specified files.

6. Main Logic (Main.py)
a. Call the Get Operating System Agent.
b. Call the Run System Diagnostic Agent.
c. Call the Error Analysis Agent.
d. If an error is found, call the Create Solution Guidance Tool.
e. Print appropriate messages as described in the objective.
